Things I need to do for this project 

1. Must be atleast two levels deep. 
2. Must use a scrapper or an API
3. Get the information from the API and send save it into objects. 

Steps on how to achieve this. 

1. Pick an API ( Urban Dictionary API ).
2. Make sure we're able to obtain all the information we need from said API to build our APP.
3. Start thinking about the flow of your project.




#flow of project 
1. I wanna welcome the user to UrbanDictionary. X 
2. Ask the User what specific term they would like for me to look up? X
3. I will then get the information from the API, Save it so I can use it later and then Display all of the definitions? and examples? Maybe?X
4. I will then allow the user to choose which definition best associates with their needs and it can then tell them more information about that term.
5. Just for fun, we're going to have a history of all the terms this user has searched during this time.
